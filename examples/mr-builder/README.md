# Nodejs Merge Request builder

In this example we're gonna show you how we reused basic components from the
Nodejs pipeline library to create a Merge Requests builder which executes
CI tests and linting in every Gitlab merge request.

## Jenkins configuration
Make sure you have included this library first.

```
home > Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Global Pipeline Libraries
```

## Jenkins job configuration
TBD 👷

## Gitlab configuration
TBD 👷
