# Jenkins pipeline library for Nodejs deployment

This is Jenkins pipeline we that are using for the deployment of Nodejs applications to the GKE clusters. It's meant to be simple and straightforward. It also addresses secrets management
with Hashicorp's Vault so you can store your passwords, API keys etc. in the secure store
and leverage functionality of Nodejs libraries such as [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (or similar) to maintain configuration variables in the different application environments.

## Requirements for your Jenkins workers

**Software**

This pipeline is using variety of third party software. Please make sure your Jenkins worker
has following binaries in the PATH:

- helm (pipeline has been tested with [2.11.0](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-helm/helm-v2.11.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz))
- docker-compose (pipeline has been tested with [1.23.1](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-Linux-x86_64))
- vault (pipeline has been tested with [0.11.4](https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/0.11.4/vault_0.11.4_linux_amd64.zip))

**Kubeconfig naming convention**

Each configured environment in the Jenkinsfile can have `kubeConfigPath` option populated in the Jenkinsfile. It's the full path of the kubeconfig for the given cluster. However you can also use the automated kubeconfig name resolution, in this case you need to save kubeconfigs in the following format:

```
config-${project_id}-${cluster_name}
```

Then just set `kubeConfigPathPrefix` and you're good to go.

## Features

### Secrets injection
TBD

### Automatic documentation compilation

If `documentation` variable specified, pipilene will try to generate
documentation with `npm run docs` command. Your nodejs script should
be configured to generate `index.html` file to the `./docs-output`
directory.

**Example:**

```json
...
"scripts": {
  "docs": "aglio -i docs/api.apib --theme-variables flatly -o docs-output/index.html"
},
...
```

**Configuration options**
- `documentation`/`bucketUrl` for example `gs://bucket-name.your.domain`
- `documentation`/`storageClass` for example `regional`
- `documentation`/`location` for example `europe-west3`
- `documentation`/`pathPrefix` for example `project-name`

## Jenkinsfile options

游댵 **/projectFriendlyName**

This option must be set, typically it's a parent project name for all your
micro services e.g. `order-hammer` so you can call `api` micro service as
`order-hammer-api`.

游댵 **/kubeConfigPathPrefix**

path to the directory where you store Kubertnetes config files. This option must
be set in case you are using automated kubeconfig name resolution mentioned in the
previous part of this document.

游댵 **/gcpDockerRegistryPrefix**

This option must be set,
[follow the official Google documentation](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing-and-pulling)
to get the right prefix.

游댵 **/sshCredentialsId**

This option must be set. It's the id of Jenkins credentials with the private
RSA key for the interaction with private Git repositories. RSA key must be
pre-processed this way:

```
sed -E ':a;N;$!ba;s/\r{0,1}\n/\\n/g' my.key
```

游댵 **/documentation**

Optional. If set - it must be a Map with following keys:
- `pathPrefix` subdirectory where yout want to put generated `index.html` file
- `bucketUrl` url of your GCS bucker starting with `gs://`
- `gcpProjectId` ID (not name!) of the GCP project where you want to create GCS bucket

游댵 **/branchEnvs**

This option must be set. It's always a Map, keys are named by Git branches.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/friendlyEnvName**

This option must be set. It's typically `production` for the `master` branch,
`development` for the `development` branch etc.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/gcpProjectId**

This option must be set. It's the ID (not name!) of your GCP project.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/gkeClusterName**

This option must be set. It's the name of Kubernetes cluster, you can get it
dirrectly in the GCP console.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/k8sNamespace**

This option must be set. Use `default` if you're using single GKE cluster for the
single environment, otherwise you can for example use the same naming convention as
for the `friendlyEnvName` naming.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/helmChart**

This option must be set. It can be chart name (helm repository name) or path of the chart
stored in the service's repository. Please note that repository is stored in `./repo`
subdirectory of the workplace so path must have `repo/` prefix.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/helmValues**

Optional. Values from this Map will be directly passed to the `values.json`
so you can access them in the Helm chart in a standard fashion e.g.
`{{ .Values.deployment.replicaCount }}`.

Please note that you should not use
following keys in this context since they're automatically generated in the
pipeline process: `secrets`, `general`.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/secretsInjection**

Optional. Configure this key if you want to obtain secrets from the Hashicorp
Vault. Content of this key must be a Map with following keys.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/secretsInjection/jenkinsCredentialsId**

This option must be set if you want to obtain secrets from the Vault.
It's the id of Jenkins credentials with the Vault token.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/secretsInjection/vaultUrl**

This option must be set if you want to obtain secrets from the Vault.
It should be the base url of your Vault instance.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/secretsInjection/secrets**

This option must be set if you want to obtain secrets from the Vault.
Content of this key must be a Map with following keys.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/secretsInjection/secrets/[]vaultSecretPath**

This option must be set if you want to obtain secrets from the Vault.
It's REST compatible path so it's compatible with KV1 or KV2.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/secretsInjection/secrets/[]keyMap**
This option must be set if you want to obtain secrets from the Vault.
Content of this key must be a List with following Maps.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/secretsInjection/secrets/[]keyMap/[]vault**
This option must be set if you want to obtain secrets from the Vault.
This key represents the remote key in the Vault document.

游댵 **/branchEnvs/[branch_name]/secretsInjection/secrets/keyMap/[]local**
This option must be set if you want to obtain secrets from the Vault.
This key represents the local key that you can use while accessing secrets
in the Helm chart. It can be the same as the remote key but keep in mind
that all secrets are put to the flat Map so local key should have unique name.

## Jenkinsfile format

**Simple example without secrets injection**

```groovy
PipelineNode{
  // app specific stuff
  projectFriendlyName = "your-awesome-project-name"
  appName = "api"
  appRole = "server"
  appTier = "backend"
  slackChannel = "#ci-channel011"

  // RSA private key for ssh operations (git)
  sshCredentialsId = "jenkins-ssh-key"
  documentation = [:] // this won't trigger documentation stage

  // following properties can be passed to certain environments (below)
  envDefaults = [
    gcpDockerRegistryPrefix: "eu.gcr.io",
    kubeConfigPathPrefix: "/home/jenkins/.kube",
    helmChart: "repo/helm/chart/default",
    injectSecretsDeployment: true,
    injectSecretsTest: true, 
    vaultAddr: "https://vault.co.uk"
    vaultTokenSecretId: "my-jenkins-secret",
    kubeConfigPathPrefix: "/home/jenkins/.kube",
    dryRun: false,
    debugMode: false,
    nodeTestEnv: [NODE_ENV: 'test', NODE_PATH: '.'],
    runLint: true,
    debugMode: false,
  ]

  branchEnvs = [:]
  branchEnvs.development = [
    friendlyEnvName: "development",
    gcpProjectId: "gcp-project-id1234",
    gkeClusterName: "development",
    k8sNamespace: "default",
    helmValues: "repo/helm/values/development.yaml",
  ]

  branchEnvs.stage = [
    friendlyEnvName: "stage",
    gcpProjectId: "gcp-project-id1234",
    gkeClusterName: "stage",
    k8sNamespace: "default",
    helmValues: "repo/helm/values/stage.yaml",
  ]

  branchEnvs.master = [
    friendlyEnvName: "production",
    gcpProjectId: "gcp-project-id1234",
    gkeClusterName: "production",
    k8sNamespace: "default",
    helmValues: "repo/helm/values/production.yaml",
  ]
}
```

## Dockerfile format
As you may have noticed - Jenkinsfile contains `jenkins-ssh-key` option. What is it for?
Well sometimes you need to use private repositories during the `npm install` phase so
this is the way how to do it. You just need to create a new Jenkins secret with the
private RSA key and adjust your Dockerfile to perform multi-stage build. Here's the example:

```Dockerfile
# BUILDER IMAGE
FROM node:8.12.0 AS builder
ARG PRIVATE_KEY
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY . /usr/src/app
RUN mkdir ~/.ssh/
# PRIVATE_KEY=$(sed -E ':a;N;$!ba;s/\r{0,1}\n/\\n/g' my.key)
RUN echo $PRIVATE_KEY > ~/.ssh/id_rsa
RUN chmod 0400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
RUN eval `ssh-agent -s` && ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
RUN ssh-keyscan your.private.gitlab.domain.co.uk > /root/.ssh/known_hosts
# build command
RUN npm set unsafe-perm true
RUN npm install

# MAIN IMAGE
FROM node:8.12.0
ENV NODE_PATH=./config:./app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/app /usr/src/app
EXPOSE 3000
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

## Future work
- enhance processing of Jenkinsfile variables. Some sort of class wrapper would be nice
